git clone https://github.com/UZI-LOADED/FlipperZero_RedBelt.git
cd FlipperZero_RedBelt

Clone the repository to your local machine where you have your Flipper Zero connected.
bash

git clone https://github.com/UZI-LOADED/FlipperZero_RedBelt.git
cd FlipperZero_RedBelt


Prepare Your Flipper Zero:

Connect your Flipper Zero device to your computer using a USB cable.
Ensure your Flipper Zero is in the correct mode to receive files (usually, this is done through the device’s settings menu).
Copy Files to Flipper Zero:

Copy the configuration files from your local repository to the appropriate directory on your Flipper Zero device.

bash
cp *.txt /path/to/FlipperZero/directory/

The exact path will depend on how your Flipper Zero is mounted on your file system.
Load and Execute Configurations:

Use the Flipper Zero interface to navigate to the directory where you copied the files.
Select each configuration file and load it as per your testing requirements.
Test and Validate:

Run the configurations on your Flipper Zero to ensure they work as expected.
Monitor the logs and outputs to verify that the configurations are functioning correctly.
Example Commands and Scripts
Here are some example commands and scripts you might use to automate the process of copying and validating the files on your Flipper Zero:

Bash Script to Copy Files
bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define the source and destination directories
SOURCE_DIR="/path/to/local/repository"
DEST_DIR="/path/to/FlipperZero/directory"

# Copy all configuration files to Flipper Zero
cp $SOURCE_DIR/*.txt $DEST_DIR/

# Verify the files have been copied
echo "Files copied to Flipper Zero:"
ls $DEST_DIR
Python Script to Validate Files
Python
import os

def validate_files(directory):
    # Check if all files are present in the directory
    expected_files = ['qr_code_approved_status.txt', 'merchant_vip_card.txt', 'loyalty_card.txt', 
                      'gift_card_validation.txt', 'wifi_camera_systems.txt', 'traffic_light_control.txt', 
                      'wiegand_garage_brute_force.txt', 'nfc_unlimited_funds.txt']
    
    missing_files = [file for file in expected_files if not os.path.isfile(os.path.join(directory, file))]
    
    if missing_files:
        print(f"Missing files: {', '.join(missing_files)}")
    else:
        print("All files are present.")
        
    # Validate the content of each file (basic validation for demonstration)
    for file in expected_files:
        with open(os.path.join(directory, file), 'r') as f:
            content = f.read()
            if 'Enable' not in content:
                print(f"File {file} may be missing some configuration.")
            else:
                print(f"File {file} is valid.")

# Directory where the files are copied
flipper_directory = "/path/to/FlipperZero/directory"

# Validate the files
validate_files(flipper_directory)
Additional Tips
Documentation: Ensure you have proper documentation for each configuration file, detailing its purpose and how to use it.
Testing Environment: Always test configurations in a controlled environment before using them in real-world scenarios.
Updates: Regularly update your repository and Flipper Zero device to incorporate new features and improvements.
By following these steps, you should be able to effectively use your Flipper Zero device with the configuration files you’ve created. If you encounter any issues, feel free to ask for further assistance!

Open a text editor (e.g., Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on macOS, or any code editor like VSCode or Sublime Text).
Copy the content of each configuration file provided above.
Paste the copied content into your text editor.
Save each file with the respective name (e.g., rfid_emulation.txt, ir_capture_replay.txt, etc.).
Copy to Flipper Zero:

Connect your Flipper Zero device to your computer.
Copy the saved files to the appropriate directory on your Flipper Zero device.
Use the Configurations:

Use the Flipper Zero interface to load and execute the configurations.
Ensure you have the necessary permissions and are operating within legal boundaries while performing tests.
Description of Each File
RFID/NFC Emulation File:

This file enables RFID and NFC emulation on your Flipper Zero.
It allows you to emulate MifareClassic and NFC TypeA cards.
You can customize the emulated card IDs and keys for different scenarios.
IR Signal Capture and Replay:

This file captures IR signals from remote controllers and replays them.
It's useful for testing IR-controlled devices like TVs, air conditioners, and other appliances.
You can customize the captured and replayed signals based on your testing needs.
GPIO Manipulation:

This file configures GPIO pins for various purposes, such as triggering alarms or testing sensors.
You can set the mode (input/output) and state (high/low) of each GPIO pin.
It's useful for testing hardware interactions and responses.
Sub-GHz Communication:

This file configures Sub-GHz communication settings for testing wireless protocols.
It enables frequency hopping and transmits a test signal.
You can customize the frequencies and signals based on the wireless devices you're testing.
